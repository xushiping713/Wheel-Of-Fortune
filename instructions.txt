The goal of Wheel of Fortune is to guess a particular phrase correctly. 
All of the phrases come from the Wheel of Fortune Category Thing. 
There are three levels of secret phrases, ‘EASY’, ‘MEDIUM’ and ‘HARD’. 
At the beginning of the game, you should choose a level:
 ‘EASY’ phrase, a ‘MEDIUM’ phrase, or a ‘HARD’ phrase. 
The harder the level, the more letters in the phrase to be guessed. 
During play each turn you click on ‘SPIN THAT WHEEL!!!’ to spin the wheel. 
If you land on a dollar amount, you will guess a consonant. 
If the puzzle contains the consonant you just guessed, it will be revealed. 
You will receive the spun dollar amount times the instances that the letter appears on the board. 
If the letter is not in the phrase nothing will happen.
Instead of guessing a consonant, you may guess a vowel. 
Vowels cost $25 regardless of how many are in the sentence. 
If you choose to guess a vowel, the dollar amount wheel landed on does not matter.
At any point you may guess the complete sentence. 
If you guess the correct sentence, you will win $100 in addition to the money you have in your wallet; 
however, if you guess incorrectly you lose the game and all of your money.
Good Luck!!!
