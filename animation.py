# A way to add animation to tkinter

# Combining classes AnimationCanvas and AnimatedObject into one module

# Fixed major bug 21 April 2015
# New version 19 April 2015:
# disable the start method when going
# add accelerate and decelerate methods

# Rhys Price Jones 7 April 2015

# AnimationCanvas extends tk.Canvas.  
# It allows you to add as many AnimatedObjects as you like with addItem()
# remove them with removeItem()
# start() and stop() are provided to start and stop the animation easily.
# The animate() method causes all the AnimatedObjects to start moving
